## Description:
The model/ folder contains the core components of our hybrid deep learning architecture.
It combines the strength of ResNet layers for granular feature capture and Vision Transformer (ViT) layers for a global understanding of images. This directory not only houses the architecture definition but also provides pre-trained weights and model checkpoints for quick deployments and evaluations.
