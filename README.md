# Hybrid_CNN_VIT_Network
This repository presents a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines the strengths of both ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) for state-of-the-art image classification tasks. 
Our model seamlessly integrates convolutional layers from ResNet for capturing local features with the self-attention mechanism of ViT to grasp global context. We experiment with various patch sizes and optimizers, and our findings suggest optimal configurations for different use-cases.

## Key Features:

Fusion of ResNet and ViT layers for robust feature extraction.
Configurable model architecture supporting different depths of ResNet (e.g., ResNet18, ResNet34) and various patch sizes.
Comprehensive performance evaluation metrics including Loss, Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC.
Recommendations on patch size and optimizer choices based on extensive experimentation.


## Results:
Our hybrid model achieves remarkable performance, particularly with the 4x4 patch size and it was mostly trained on cifar10 and cifar100

## Usage:
Easy-to-use scripts and notebooks are provided for training and evaluating the model on your own datasets.

##Contribution:
Feel free to open issues for questions, discussions, or any suggestions for improvement. Pull requests are also welcome!
